### About Me

Currently a Post Doctoral Research Associate at Technical University of Darmstadt. My current research is focused on solvation thermodynamics of polymers and dynamically consistent coarse-graining methods.

In my previous postdoctoral stint at Molecular Biophysics Unit, Indian Institute of Science Bangalore, I focused on the biophysical aspect of allostery in proteins and dynamic heterogeneity in biological membranes. As a graduate student in the Department of Physics at Indian Institute of technology, Madras, my research interests included theoretical soft matter and computational physics, with a focus on developing systematic coarse-grained models for macromolecular simulations.

### Technical Expertise

Systematic coarse-graining methodologies for multiscale modeling.
Molecular Dynamics (atomistic/mesoscale) simulations
Monte-Carlo simulations
Ab-initio/DFT calculations
Non-linear numerical optimizations
